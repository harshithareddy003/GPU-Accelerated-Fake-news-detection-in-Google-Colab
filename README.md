 GPU-Accelerated Fake News Detection

This project implements a Fake News Detection System using Machine Learning / Deep Learning models, accelerated with Google Colab GPUs. The goal is to classify news articles as real or fake by analyzing textual content.

 Features

End-to-end pipeline for fake news classification.

Preprocessing of raw text (tokenization, stopword removal, lemmatization).

Feature extraction with TF-IDF / Word Embeddings.

Model training using ML/DL classifiers (Logistic Regression, LSTM, BERT, etc.).

GPU acceleration on Google Colab for faster training and evaluation.

Evaluation with metrics: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score.
